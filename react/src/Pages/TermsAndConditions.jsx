          You must pay a security deposit before receiving any dresses. Dresses will not be provided without this deposit.

          Closet is not responsible for reminding renters to pick up or drop off dresses. We won't refund missed pickups or deliveries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">5.</span>
          Please check the dress thoroughly at delivery. Closet isn't responsible for any flaws noticed after delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">6.</span>
          You cannot take dresses outside your local area without permission from Closet.

          If the dress is damaged in any way, the renter will need to pay for repairs or replacement, as decided by Closet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">9.</span>
          If you don't return the dress on time or break any policies, legal action may be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">10.</span>
          If Closet considers your behavior inappropriate, future orders may be canceled without notice.

        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">11.</span>
          No alterations are allowed on dresses. Altering a dress counts as damage.

          Late returns will be charged a 25% penalty of the rental fee for each day late.

          Security deposits may take up to 7 working days to return after the dress is successfully returned, and will be sent to your provided bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold mr-2">15.</span>
          If you book a dress for someone else under your name, you are responsible for that order.
